You are building an application that needs to let users upload their own documents. Follow these simple instructions for Step 1:

**Step 1: Document Import ðŸ“¤**

* Show a area where users can click to pick a file from their computer.
* Make sure this file picker lets them select at least PDF files.
* (Optional) you have to support more kinds of documents, also allow files like .epub, .mobi, .docx, or .txt. Each extra format may need its own parsing library.
* Decide where to keep the uploaded files:

  * **Temporary storage** if you only need them for immediate processing, then you can delete them later.

Thatâ€™s itâ€”just implement a simple file picker that accepts PDFs (and others if you choose) and decide how and where to store the uploads.
