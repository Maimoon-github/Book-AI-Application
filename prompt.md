You are tasked with building a Book-AI-Application that can import a PDF or book-related document, identify its topics or chapters, and break them into separate ‚Äúchunks‚Äù with their page information. Follow these steps:

1. **Document Import**

   * Create a file picker so users can upload documents (PDFs, and optionally EPUB, MOBI, DOCX, or TXT).
   * Decide if you‚Äôll store the uploads temporarily (just for processing) or permanently (for later access).

2. **Content Extraction**

   * For PDFs, use a library like PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text and metadata.
   * If possible, extract bookmarks or a table of contents (ToC) from the PDF; these often list chapter titles and start pages.
   * Optionally, analyze fonts or layout (font size, bold/italic) to find headings if no ToC exists.

3. **Topic/Chapter Identification**

   * **If you have a ToC/bookmarks:** Each entry gives you a chapter title and the page where it starts. The chapter ends right before the next one starts (or at the end of the document).
   * **If no ToC/bookmarks:**

     * Scan each page‚Äôs text and look for patterns like ‚ÄúChapter X‚Äù, ‚ÄúPart X‚Äù, or other consistent headings using regular expressions.
     * You can also inspect font sizes or positions (if your library provides that) to detect titles.
   * (Advanced) If there are no clear markers, you could use NLP methods (e.g., topic modeling) to find where the subject changes‚Äîthough this is more complex.

4. **Content Chunking and Page Association**

   * Once you know each chapter‚Äôs start page (and where it ends), extract text for that range of pages.
   * If a chapter starts or ends mid-page, use layout info (coordinates) to get only the relevant portion.
   * For each chunk, save:

     * Chapter title
     * Chunk text
     * Starting page number
     * Ending page number

5. **Presenting the Chunks**

   * In your app‚Äôs UI, list all identified chapters.
   * When a user selects a chapter, show its text and clearly display the page range.
   * Allow easy navigation between chunks, and optionally add a search feature (within a chunk or across all chunks).

**Example Pseudocode (Python-like):**

```
# Assume 'uploaded_pdf_file' is the path to the user‚Äôs PDF

# Step 2: Extract basic structure
pdf = open_pdf(uploaded_pdf_file)  # e.g., using fitz or PyPDF2
chapters = extract_bookmarks(pdf)  # [(title, start_page), ...]

# Step 3: Identify chapters
if chapters:
    identified = chapters
else:
    all_text = {}
    for pg in range(pdf.page_count):
        text = extract_text_from_page(pdf, pg)
        all_text[pg] = text
    identified = find_chapter_starts(all_text)  # custom function

# Determine end pages
sections = []
for i, (title, start) in enumerate(identified):
    end = pdf.page_count - 1
    if i + 1 < len(identified):
        end = identified[i+1][1] - 1
    sections.append((title, start, end))

# Step 4: Chunk content
chunks = []
for title, start, end in sections:
    text = ""
    for pg in range(start, end + 1):
        text += extract_text_from_page(pdf, pg) + "\n"
    chunks.append({
        "title": title,
        "content": text.strip(),
        "start_page": start,
        "end_page": end
    })

close_pdf(pdf)
# Step 5 is handled in your UI code
```

**Key Points to Remember**

* Use Python (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or PyMuPDF) for PDF parsing.
* Scanned PDFs need OCR (e.g., Tesseract) before you can extract text.
* The success of chapter detection depends on how well-structured the PDF is.
* Design your UI so users can easily select chapters, read chunks, and see page info.
* Implement robust error handling for encrypted or corrupted files.

Good luck! üëç
