You're looking for a detailed, step-by-step guide to functionally implement Hierarchical Chunking, Metadata-Augmentation, and Hybrid Search for your RAG-based AI teacher chatbot. This isn't a prompt for an LLM to *generate text*, but rather a "prompt" or detailed plan for *you* to execute in your development environment (likely using Python and relevant libraries).

Here's a functional breakdown of each technique, designed to be executed sequentially:

---

### **Prompt 1: Hierarchical Chunking (Chapter-aware with Semantic Sub-chunking)**

**Goal:** To break down your educational content first by chapters, and then further subdivide each chapter into semantically coherent, smaller chunks that are ideal for retrieval.

**Input:** Raw educational text content (e.g., a textbook as a single large string, or a list of strings where each string is a chapter).

**Output:** A list of structured "chunk objects," where each object contains the `text_content` of the chunk and initial placeholder `metadata` including its originating `chapter_number` and `chapter_title`.

---

**Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**

**Step 1: Define Chapter Boundaries and Extract Raw Chapter Text**

* **Action:** If your content is one continuous text, identify clear markers for chapter beginnings and ends (e.g., "Chapter 1:", "## Chapter Title"). If each chapter is already a separate file or string, this step is simpler.
* **Method:**
    * Programmatically split the large text into individual chapter strings.
    * Extract the `chapter_number` and `chapter_title` for each.
* **Example (Conceptual):**
    ```
    raw_text = "Chapter 1: Introduction. This chapter introduces... Chapter 2: Core Concepts. Here we dive into..."
    chapters_data = [
        {"number": 1, "title": "Introduction", "text": "This chapter introduces..."},
        {"number": 2, "title": "Core Concepts", "text": "Here we dive into..."},
        # ... and so on
    ]
    ```

**Step 2: Implement Semantic Sub-Chunking within Each Chapter**

* **Action:** For each raw chapter text extracted in Step 1, break it down into smaller, semantically meaningful units.
* **Method (Semantic Splitter):**
    1.  **Sentence Segmentation:** First, robustly split the chapter text into individual sentences. Libraries like `nltk.sent_tokenize` are useful here.
    2.  **Sentence Embedding:** Use a pre-trained sentence embedding model (e.g., from `sentence-transformers` like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to get vector representations for *each sentence*.
    3.  **Similarity Measurement:** Calculate the cosine similarity between adjacent sentence embeddings.
    4.  **Boundary Detection:** Identify "breaks" in semantic flow where the similarity drops below a predefined threshold. These low-similarity points indicate good places to create a new chunk.
    5.  **Chunk Formation:** Group sentences between these detected boundaries into individual semantic chunks.
    6.  **Overlap (Optional but Recommended):** Introduce a small overlap between consecutive semantic chunks (e.g., including the last 1-2 sentences of the previous chunk in the beginning of the current one) to ensure context isn't lost at boundaries.
* **Conceptual Algorithm for Semantic Chunking:**
    ```python
    def semantic_chunk_chapter(chapter_text, chapter_number, chapter_title, model):
        sentences = sent_tokenize(chapter_text)
        sentence_embeddings = model.encode(sentences, convert_to_tensor=True)
        
        chunks = []
        current_chunk_sentences = []
        
        for i in range(len(sentences)):
            current_chunk_sentences.append(sentences[i])
            if i < len(sentences) - 1:
                # Calculate similarity between current sentence and next
                similarity = util.cos_sim(sentence_embeddings[i], sentence_embeddings[i+1]).item()
                # If similarity is low, it's a good chunk boundary
                if similarity < semantic_threshold: # Define your threshold (e.g., 0.5-0.7)
                    chunks.append({
                        "text_content": " ".join(current_chunk_sentences),
                        "metadata": {"chapter_number": chapter_number, "chapter_title": chapter_title}
                    })
                    current_chunk_sentences = [] # Start a new chunk
                    # Add overlap if desired (e.g., add last sentence(s) of previous chunk)
                    # if overlap_sentences and len(chunks) > 0:
                    #     current_chunk_sentences.extend(chunks[-1]["text_content"].split('.')[-overlap_sentences:])
            else:
                # Add the last chunk
                chunks.append({
                    "text_content": " ".join(current_chunk_sentences),
                    "metadata": {"chapter_number": chapter_number, "chapter_title": chapter_title}
                })
        return chunks
    ```

**Step 3: Collect All Chunks**

* **Action:** Aggregate all the semantically sub-chunked data from all chapters into a single list of chunk objects.
* **Result:** You will have a `list` of `dict` objects, where each dict represents a chunk:
    ```
    [
        {"text_content": "...", "metadata": {"chapter_number": 1, "chapter_title": "Introduction"}},
        {"text_content": "...", "metadata": {"chapter_number": 1, "chapter_title": "Introduction"}},
        {"text_content": "...", "metadata": {"chapter_number": 2, "chapter_title": "Core Concepts"}},
        # ... etc.
    ]
    ```

### **Prompt 2: Metadata-Augmentation**

**Goal:** To enrich each chunk object with more specific, retrievable metadata beyond just chapter information. This additional context will be vital for precise retrieval.

**Input:** The list of chunk objects generated from Hierarchical Chunking (each with `text_content`, `chapter_number`, `chapter_title`).

**Output:** The same list of chunk objects, but with significantly more detailed `metadata` for each chunk.

---

**Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**

**Step 1: Add Section/Sub-heading Information (if applicable)**

* **Action:** If your chapters have a consistent internal structure (e.g., "1.1 Introduction," "1.2 Theory"), extract these headings and associate them with the relevant semantic chunks.
* **Method:**
    * During the semantic chunking process (Step 2 of Prompt 1), you can attempt to identify headings within the text.
    * Associate the most recent heading with the chunks that follow it until the next heading.
* **Example Metadata Addition:**
    ```python
    # ... within your chunking loop ...
    current_chunk_metadata["section_title"] = "Some Specific Section"
    current_chunk_metadata["section_number"] = "1.2"
    ```

**Step 2: Extract Keywords/Topics for Each Chunk**

* **Action:** Identify the most representative keywords or topics within each `text_content` of a chunk.
* **Method Options:**
    1.  **LLM-based Extraction (Recommended for AI Teachers):**
        * Send the `text_content` of each chunk to a capable LLM (e.g., Gemini-2.0-Flash) with a prompt like:
            ```
            "Given the following text, identify 3-5 key topics or keywords that accurately describe its content. List them as a comma-separated string."
            Text: "{chunk['text_content']}"
            Keywords:
            ```
        * Parse the LLM's response to get the keywords.
    2.  **Automated Keyword Extraction Libraries:** Use libraries like `rake-nltk`, `KeyBERT`, or `YAKE` to extract keywords. These are faster but might be less semantically rich than LLM-extracted keywords.
    3.  **TF-IDF or BERT-based Keyword Scoring:** Calculate TF-IDF scores for terms within the chunk relative to the entire corpus of chunks, or use embedding similarity to find terms most central to the chunk's meaning.
* **Example Metadata Addition:**
    ```python
    chunk_metadata["keywords"] = "photosynthesis, light reactions, chloroplasts, energy conversion"
    ```

**Step 3: Add Additional Pedagogical Metadata (Highly Recommended for AI Teachers)**

* **Action:** Think about what an AI teacher needs to know about a piece of content to teach effectively.
* **Method (Often Manual or Rule-Based/LLM-Assisted):**
    * **Difficulty Level:** `chunk_metadata["difficulty_level"] = "beginner"` (Could be inferred by LLM or manually assigned).
    * **Learning Objectives:** `chunk_metadata["learning_objective"] = "Students will be able to describe the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis."` (Best if associated with source curriculum).
    * **Question Type Relevance:** `chunk_metadata["relevant_question_types"] = ["definition", "process explanation"]` (LLM-inferred or manually tagged).
* **Example of a fully augmented chunk object:**
    ```json
    {
        "chunk_id": "unique_id_123", // Generate a unique ID for each chunk
        "text_content": "The process of photosynthesis primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells...",
        "embedding": [...], // This will be added in Hybrid Search Step 1
        "metadata": {
            "chapter_number": 2,
            "chapter_title": "Core Concepts of Biology",
            "section_title": "Photosynthesis: Light-Dependent Reactions",
            "section_number": "2.1.1",
            "keywords": ["photosynthesis", "chloroplasts", "light reactions", "plant cells"],
            "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
            "learning_objective": "Explain the role of chloroplasts in photosynthesis.",
            "source_url": "link_to_original_chapter_online.pdf", // If applicable
            "page_range": "35-37" // If applicable
        }
    }
    ```

### **Prompt 3: Hybrid Search (Semantic + Keyword)**

**Goal:** To combine the strengths of semantic understanding (finding conceptual matches) and keyword matching (finding exact terms) to retrieve the most relevant chunks for a user's query.

**Input:**
* User's natural language query (e.g., "How do plants make food?").
* The list of augmented chunk objects (each with `text_content` and detailed `metadata`).

**Output:** A ranked list of the most relevant chunk objects, ready to be passed as context to your generative LLM for answer generation.

---

**Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**

**Step 1: Create and Populate Retrieval Indexes**

* **Action:** You need two types of indexes: one for semantic similarity and one for keyword matching.
* **Method:**
    1.  **Vector Database (for Semantic Search):**
        * **Chunk Embedding:** For *each* `text_content` in your augmented chunk list, generate its vector embedding using the same sentence embedding model you used for semantic chunking (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). Store this `embedding` vector in the chunk object.
        * **Index Creation:** Initialize a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Annoy, Pinecone, Milvus, ChromaDB, Weaviate). Add all your chunk embeddings to this index.
        * **Metadata Storage:** Ensure your vector database can store or link to the full `metadata` of each chunk alongside its embedding.
    2.  **Keyword Search Index (for Keyword Search):**
        * **Index Creation:** Use a library for full-text search (e.g., `BM25` implementation from `rank_bm25`, or a full-fledged search engine like Whoosh or Elasticsearch for larger scale).
        * **Document Indexing:** Index the `text_content` of each chunk in this keyword index.
        * **Linkage:** Ensure you can retrieve the `chunk_id` (or similar identifier) from this index so you can link back to your full chunk object.

**Step 2: Process User Query and Perform Parallel Retrieval**

* **Action:** When a user asks a question, retrieve relevant chunks using both indexes simultaneously.
* **Method:**
    1.  **Embed User Query:** Use the *same* sentence embedding model to generate an embedding for the user's query.
    2.  **Semantic Search:** Query your vector database with the user's query embedding. Retrieve the `Top-K` (e.g., 10-20) most semantically similar chunk objects (or their IDs).
    3.  **Keyword Search:** Query your keyword index with the user's raw query text. Retrieve the `Top-K` (e.g., 10-20) most keyword-relevant chunk IDs.
    4.  **Initial Pool:** Combine the IDs of all chunks retrieved from both semantic and keyword searches into a single pool, ensuring no duplicates.

**Step 3: Fuse and Re-rank Retrieved Chunks (Reciprocal Rank Fusion - RRF)**

* **Action:** Combine the results from both retrieval methods, giving higher preference to chunks that appear high in *both* rankings.
* **Method (Reciprocal Rank Fusion - RRF):**
    1.  For each chunk ID in your combined pool:
        * **Get Rank from Semantic Search:** Find its rank `r_s` in the semantic results (1 for the top result, 2 for the second, etc.). If not in semantic results, assign a very low rank (e.g., `K + 1`).
        * **Get Rank from Keyword Search:** Find its rank `r_k` in the keyword results. If not in keyword results, assign a very low rank.
        * **Calculate RRF Score:** `Score = 1/(k + r_s) + 1/(k + r_k)` (where `k` is a constant, typically 60 for good performance).
    2.  **Rank All Chunks:** Sort all chunks in the pool by their calculated RRF Score in descending order.
    3.  **Select Top N:** Choose the `Top N` (e.g., 5-10) chunks from this final ranked list.

**Step 4: Prepare Context for Generative LLM**

* **Action:** Extract the `text_content` from the `Top N` fused chunks and present them as a coherent context for the AI teacher.
* **Method:**
    * Concatenate the `text_content` of the selected chunks, perhaps separated by clear markers like "--- Chunk [Chapter:Section] ---".
    * Optionally, include source citations (chapter/section/page) for each chunk.
* **Example Prompt for Generative LLM:**
    ```
    "You are an AI teacher. Answer the student's question concisely and accurately, *only* using the provided context. If the answer is not found in the context, state that you don't know."

    "**Student Question:** {user_query}"

    "**Context from Curriculum:**"
    "--- Chunk 1 (Chapter 2, Section 2.1.1): {text_content_of_chunk_1}"
    "--- Chunk 2 (Chapter 2, Section 2.1.2): {text_content_of_chunk_2}"
    "--- Chunk 3 (Chapter 1, Section 1.3): {text_content_of_chunk_3}"
    # ... up to Top N chunks

    "**Your Answer:**"
    ```
